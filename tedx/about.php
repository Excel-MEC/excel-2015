					<p ><span class="imp">TED</span> is a non-profit organisation devoted to “Ideas worth spreading”. Started in 1984 as a conference where technology, entertainment and design converged, TED shares ideas from a broad spectrum — from science to business to global issues — in more than 100 languages. Meanwhile, independent TED<sup>x</sup> events help share ideas in communities around the world.</p>
					<h4><span class="imp">TED</span> MISSION</h4>
					<p><span class="imp">TED</span> is a global community, welcoming people from every discipline and culture who seek a deeper understanding of the world. Today, TED has grown to support those world-changing ideas with many initiatives. At a TED conference, the world's leading thinkers and doers are asked to give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes or less.</p>

					<p>Past speakers at <span class="imp">TED</span> events include Bill Clinton, Jane Goodall, Al Gore, Gordon Brown, Richard Dawkins, Richard Stallman, Bill Gates, Bono, Mike Rowe, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and many Nobel Prize winners.</p>

					<p>Three major <span class="imp">TED</span> events are held each year: The TED Conference takes place every spring in Vancouver, Canada, simultaneous with TEDActive, in Whistler, BC; and the TEDGlobal Conference takes place each summer in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>

					<p>On TED.com, talks from <span class="imp">TED</span> conferences are streamed free as TED Talks videos. A new TED Talk is posted every weekday.</p>

					<p>As of February 2015, over 1,900 talks are freely available on the website. In June 2011, the talks' combined viewing figure stood at more than 500 million, and by November 2012, TED talks had been watched over one billion times worldwide.</p>

					<p>The annual <span class="imp">TED</span> Prize grants $1 million to an exceptional individual with a wish to change the world. The TED Fellows program helps world-changing innovators from around the globe to become part of the TED community and, with its help, amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities. TED-Ed creates short video lessons by pairing master teachers with animators, for use in classroom instruction or independent learning.</p>
