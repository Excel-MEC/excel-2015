                        Teams are required to build a wireless/wired robot which is capable of navigating an obstacle filled environment within the least possible time.
                        <br><br>The event itself comprises of one single round. Each team is allotted a duration of 15 minutes to complete the task (i.e finish the race) and will get only three chances. The bot will have to start from the initial position, navigate the path by itself, avoid all obstacles and get to the finishing point.
                        <br><br>Each team will initially be given 50 points. In case of the bot touching the boundary, or in case of each chance after the first, points would be deducted. The team that completes the event in the shortest time compared to other teams would earn bonus points.
                        <br><br>The team having the most points at the end of the event, is judged the winner.
