                                The subject of empowerment of women and also their security has become a burning issue all
                                over the world including India since last few decades. Excel 2015 in association with WIE MEC takes up this issue
                                and has in its agenda to spread awareness to women in rural areas, by conducting campaign  regarding the safety
                                issues faced by women in today’s world, especially  the ones due to misuse of technology. In addition to that,
                                by teaming up with a medical wing we plan to conduct a general medical camp along with breast cancer awareness
                                program, which would be of utmost relevance in the detection of the disease at a very early phase and also
                                regarding its treatment. Besides that, we intend to provide basic tips on cleanliness and personal hygiene
                                educate them on the health hazards caused due to unhygienic living.  

                                <br><br>Excel-2015 also aims to ensure a secure and bright future for the girls. By visiting
                                Government girl’s schools and interacting with the students, we give them an insight into what
                                exactly engineering is and the abundance of job opportunities that await them. We also motivate 
                                girls to discover a passion for technology, science and engineering. Moreover, they are made aware
                                of the Government organisations or NGOs that provide free or subsidised rates for entrance coaching
                                and higher education which would further encourage them to pursue their education. Through hands-on
                                learning, we empower the next generation of innovators and leaders.

                            <p class=" center-align">Improper disposal of waste is a grave issue that we all encounter on a daily basis.
                                Waste cannot be simply thrown away anymore, now it must be managed. Are you aware that you are throwing
                                away many materials that could be saved? Although managing the trash seems to be a tedious process,
                                once implemented scientifically the major hazards of improper waste management can be tackled to a great
                                extent. Excel 2015 in association with NSS MEC aims to solve this problem using the mantra of 3Rs- Reduce,
                                Reuse, Recycle. Many items that are dumped as garbage can be reused, at least to serve the purpose of
                                garbage cans and can be implemented in all the nooks and corner of the campus. These ‘garbage-garbage cans’
                                will be put into effective utilisation and also proper disposal of the waste collected will be ensured.

                                their children getting trapped into? Drugs, Alcohol? Definitely. But there is also something that can
                                be even more dangerous in the upcoming years. TECHNOLOGY. Extensive research is being performed in this
                                arena in the recent years. Researchers from the University of Glasgow found that half of the study
                                participants reported checking their email once an hour, while some individuals check up to 30 to 40 times
                                an hour. An AOL study revealed that 59 percent of PDA users check every single time an email arrives and 83
                                percent check email every day on vacation. 

                                <br><br>Social networking sites, gaming activities and several more today have become a part and parcel
                                of every teen’s life. Through this campaign we hope to make the current generation aware of the positives
                                and negatives of technology. We would like to spread the message across school students that technology
                                usage is definitely not bad but over usage can lead to extremely grave ill-effects. We aim to cover schools
                                in and around Kochi over a span of 1 month trying to make school students aware of the grave repercussions of
                                technology addiction and also motivate them to set apart a certain duration of time from their daily life away
                                from all gadgets and try and spend this quality time by engaging in several other productive activities.
