The best teams that we have encountered have a few things in common :teamwork, impeccable sync, immeasurable confidence in each other and the ability to pick up from where his predecessor left, better his effort and win the title. Time is of essence here and teams not in sync fall apart.

                        This on-the-spot event bears resemblance to a 4*100m athletic relay race. Four members of
                        the team with one relay which is your computer. Each member makes an attempt at solving the
                        problem statement by continuing from where the previous member left off.The fastest and the
                        smartest team shall win the race. <br><br>

                        The event will comprise of two stages.<br><br>


                        Preliminary round consists of both objective and subjective type tests.
                        After the preliminary round, eight teams with the highest scores will
                        be selected for the final round.<br><br>  
                        Final round comprises of 3 questions. The team can skip a question and move on to the next
                        question, but no discussion would be allowed within the team. The decision of the
                        team member is applicable to the whole team.
                        <br><br> 
                        The team members must decide which order they wish to follow before the final
                        round question has been provided, and will not be allowed to change this order
                        <br><br> 
                        The question will be provided to each member only at the start of their time
                        slot, and not before the first member's time slot. Once the question has been
                        provided, each member can code for 3 minutes at the beginning.<br><br> 
                        In the first 30 minutes, each member can code for 3 mins. In the next 30 mins,
                        the coding time increases to 4 mins. In the next 30 minutes, coding takes place
                        for 5 minutes. In the final 30 minutes, each member gets 2 minutes to code.<br><br> 
                        Duration for the final round is two hours. The teams that get the desired output
                        in the shortest time stand a chance to win the prize money.
