                        <b>PLAYERS:</b> Only three field players at one time plus a maximum of one sub per team. Players cannot play for multiple teams. There are no goalkeepers allowed. Substitutions may occur at any dead ball situation, but players must get referee's attention to enter.
                        <br><br><b>NO OFFSIDES:</b> NO SLIDE TACKLING ALLOWED
                        <br><br><b>GOAL AREA:</b> The goal area, which will be marked, is directly in front of the goal. Defenders cannot touch the ball within the goal area, however any player may move through the goal area. If a defender touches the ball in the goal area, a penalty kick is awarded to the offensive team.
                        <br><br><b>GAME DURATION:</b> Each game will last 10 minutes. If no goals have been scored after the allotted time or if the scores are tied, then a penalty shootout shall follow. In a penalty shootout each team is awarded 3 penalty kicks each.
                        <br><br><b>THREE YARD RULE:</b> In all dead ball situations, defending players must stand at least 3 yards away from the ball. If the defensive player's goal area is closer than 3 yards, the ball shall be placed 3 yards from the goal area in line with the place of the penalty.
                        <br><br><b>DEAD BALLS:</b> All dead ball kicks (kick-ins, free kicks, kick-offs) are indirect with exception of penalty kicks.
                        <br><br><b>KICK OFF:</b> May be taken in any direction.
                        <br><br><b>PENALTY KICKS:</b> Shall be awarded if, in the referee's opinion, a scoring opportunity was nullified by the infraction. Penalty kicks have to be taken from the center of the field and no goalkeeper is allowed.
                        <br><br><b>PLAYER EJECTION (YELLOW/RED CARD):</b> Referee has the right to eject a player from the game for continual disobedience or as a result of an incident that warrants sending the player off. A Yellow Card will be issued as a warning and a Red Card will be issued for a serious offence or on receipt of a second Yellow Card. The tournament organizers will decide suspension from additional games.
                        <br><br><b>GENERAL RULES</b>
