			Lifeline consists of 3 stages and will test participants on their knowledge of electronics, its applications in the field of biomedical engineering and their ability to diagnose and debug problems related to a circuit as quickly as possible. 

<br><br><b>PRELIMS:</b>
<br>1. This round consists of a 30 minute MCQ test. 
<br>2. The test will contain electronics and biomed related questions. 
<br>3. Ten teams selected from this round will proceed to the next round. 

<br><br><b>SEMI FINALS:</b>
<br>Following your instincts is crucial when you are dealing with a life waiting to be saved and all you have is limited time. This round tests your ability to make decisions and execute them in the given time. 
<br>1. The round consists of three biomedical circuit level tasks which tests your practical electronics knowledge. 
<br>2. Only four teams which complete the tasks first will make their way to the next round. 

<br><br><b>FINALS:</b>
<br>Careful what you do, because one mistake from the biomedical engineer, its not an IC burnt, but a life lost. 
<br>Small innovative designs from you today could be the technology of tomorrow. This round brings out the scientist in you. 
<br>1. In this round, you will be asked to design and/or implement a circuit which will be the solution for a real life problem. 
<br>2. Winner will be selected depending on the perfection and implementation of the circuit.
