                <b>Round 1 (Preliminary Round)</b> 

<br>1. Each robot will be allotted an opponent and each pair of opponents will take on each other in a one-on-one fight and the winner is the one with higher points at the end of the battle. The winner proceeds to the next round. 

<br><br>2. Points are awarded based on the following fields - speed, skill, controlling ability and strength. 

<br><br>3. Each bot will have to travel through an inclined surface in order to reach the battlefield. The bot quicker to accomplish this will receive bonus points.

<br><br>At the end of this round, only 4 bots will proceed to fight the next and final round. They will be the ones with the highest point. 


<br><br><b>Round 3 (The Semi-finals) </b> 

<br>1. One-on-One Knockout. 

<br><br>2. There will be two semi-finals. 

<br><br>3. The winners of the two semi-finals will qualify to the Grand Finale.

<br>1. Knockout – 10 point. 
<br>2. Immobilising the opponent for 15 seconds – 10 point. 


<br><br><b>Round 4 (The Grand finale) </b>
<br>1. One-on-one knockout round. 

<br><br>2. 10 minute battle. 

<br><br>3. The bot with the maximum points wins. 


<br><br>Point Distribution: 
<br>1. Knockout – 10 point. 
<br>2. Immobilising the opponent for 10 seconds – 10 point . 


<br><br>NOTE: POINTS ARE NOT CARRIED TO THE NEXT LEVEL. Higher points at the end of a round do not guarantee any leverage in the next round(s).
